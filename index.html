    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Spencer Hart, and this blog is a reflection of the journey that changed my life.</p>
    <p>For a long time, I struggled—with my weight, with my health, and with finding peace. Recovery wasn’t something I planned for. It found me at a point when I felt broken, lost, and tired of starting over. But what I’ve come to learn is this: <em>starting over is still a step forward.</em></p>
    <p>This space is where I share my story of recovery—from rehab and addiction, from unhealthy habits, and from the mindset that told me I’d never be enough. Every day is a choice, and while some days are harder than others, each one brings a chance to grow stronger and kinder to myself.</p>
    <p>I created this blog not just to document my progress, but to connect—with anyone who’s been where I’ve been, who’s still trying, or who just needs to know they’re not alone. If that’s you: I see you. I believe in you. And I’m walking beside you, one day at a time.</p>

      <h3>Day 174 (Day 1 of Blog): The Breakdown</h3>
      <p> Today marks the first day of this blog—and the first day I’m truly opening up about my journey. I’ve tried to start over so many times before, but something feels different now. Maybe it’s because I’m no longer trying to do this alone. I’m sharing my story with the hope that someone else sees a part of themselves in it.</p>
      <p> On November 13th, I was on the 6th day of experiencing extreme fatigue, and severe shortness of breath.  I've been overweight my entire life, so shortness of breath was nothing abnormal, but this was very very severe.  I am not a doctor person.  Hospitals, and doctors scare me.  But after lots of pleading and begging from my sister, Bailey, I agreed to call 911 and to go to the doctor.  Little did I know that it would be the last time I see my apartment for a very long time.  </p>
      <p> Upon arrival to the Emergency Room, I was admitted and placed on oxygen and blood was taken to run labs.  Later that evening, in front of lots of family, I was informed that my CO2 level in my body was nearly quintuple what it should be, and that I needed to be intubated immediately.  I was diagnosed with Obese Hypoventilation Syndrome and Respiratory Failure. My mom Kristi, and stepfather, Jon, were both in Florida for their normally snowbird stay during the winter season.  They flew home as soon as I could, but they would not be there when I was placed under anesthesia and intubated.  There was concern about whether I would survive the operation due to my respiratory failure.  My girlfriend, Kenzie, who lives in Michigan, received a call in the middle of the night as almost to say, "Maybe Goodbye, and I love you." </p>
      <p> What followed was nothing short of hell on earth for every person I loved.  For me, it felt like a matter of hours, but for everyone else it was 5 long excruciating days.  I was placed in a medically induced coma for 5 days to get my respiratory failure under control.  When I woke up, I was surrounded by my family.  Aunts from out of town had come in, Mom and Jon had also returned to be my side the entire time.  Photos available in the media tab of this blog will show what my family experienced when I was in a coma.  After approximately 13 days of intubation, there was talk of sending me to UW Health in Madison, WI for a procedure called a Tracheotomy.  That procedure would consist them cutting open my throat, and placing a tube in my trachea to assist me to breathe. Upon my arrival at UW Health, I was greeted by Dr. Long, who took a look at my chart, and my current oxygen stats.  He told me to take a deep breath with the tube still in my throat.  When I did that, I was informed that I would not need the tracheotomy, and that I would be extubated that night.  30 minutes later, I was extubated, and began to breath on my own with an oxygen mask.  </p>
      <p> Once I was extubated, the main focus moved into Wound Care.  While in a coma, I was left on my back for 5 straight days to allow for the respiratory to get under control.  Unfortunately because of this, I was left with pressure ulcers on my back, and my butt.  These wounds were EXTENSIVE and required around tbe clock care.  These wounds are still being cared for to this day.  However, because I was no longer a risk for Respiratory, I was transferred back to Weston Hospital where I began to continue recovery and start the beginning stages of Physical & Occupational Therapy.  </p>
      <p> I had not stood in 2 months at this point, I had been bedridden since my arrival at the ER in November.  I knew the road to recovery was going to be long, and hard, and cruel sometimes.  However, from the get go, my therapists were incredibly patient, nice, and rockstars.  Brad, and Sammie at Weston Hospital were with me most days to get me stood up using a sit to stand EZ lift.  I was unable to stand on my own.  After about a month back home in Weston, I was transferred to Select Specialty back in Madison, WI.  The focus here was to be extensive wound care and continued rehabilitation.  </p>
      <p> During my approximately 2 month stay at Select Speciality, my Physical Therapy continued to focus on starting the motions of standing on my own.  After about a month, I was finally able to stand up on my own.  That day was a monumental one, as my recovery began to increase exponentially.  A few days later, I was able to take 3 steps forward, and backwards.  A few days after to that, I was able to take about 15 steps to the door and back.  A week after that? 14 feet outside of my room.  My team at Select, led by Jay was incredible.  THey were again very kind and patient, but also a bit more motivating to get me going as they could now see that I was progressing much better being on my feet.  </p>
      <p> On February 27th, I was transferred back to Wausau, WI to PAM Health Rehabilitation Hospital where I am currently residing for continued to rehabilitation and to further my wound care.  My time here has very much had it's ups and downs with care.  The building is understaffed, and it absolutely shows.  The staff that IS here had been fantastic.  Unfortunately since being here, I had contracted 3 separate infections that has set back my wound healing.  The wound care team that is contracted by PAM is run by Dr. Kevin Ferriera and his nurse practitioner, Shannon.  They are nothing short of INCREDIBLE.  Sporting an "island" accent, he greets me every time like it's the first time we meet, and he is very personable and funny.  </p>
      <p> That basically catches everyone up to today, May 6th, 2025.  I will be updating this website as much as I can, hopefully everyday! Thank you all for being here on this journey, and if it's the first time you're here, Welcome!! </p>
